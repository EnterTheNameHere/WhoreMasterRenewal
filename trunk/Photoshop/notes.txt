These files were created in Photoshop CS4. The font "Hobo Std" is used for basically everything, with the exception noted below.

For most buttons, you can simply edit the text in the text field; the text will stay centered.

To get the initial "Off" button image, make sure the "Button (disabled)" layer is hidden and the "Button" layer is visible and the Stroke effect is visible on the "Text" layer.
Then, hide the Stroke effect on the "Text" layer and you'll have the "On" button image.
Finally, set the "Button (disabled)" layer to visible and the "Button" layer to hidden (preventing bleedthrough around the corners) and you have the "Disabled" button image.

The up/down/left/right arrows were done with the Arial font and their size and position were tweaked, but they are indeed text.
